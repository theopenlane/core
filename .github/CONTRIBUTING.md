# Contributing

Please read the [contributing](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide as well as the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). You will be required to sign all commits to the Openlane project, so if you're unfamiliar with how to set that up, see [github's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).

Given external users will not have write to the branches in this repository, you'll need to follow the forking process to open a PR - [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) is a guide from github on how to do so.

## Tools

Developing against this repo involves a few mandatory tools; please read up on
these and familiarize yourself if you're interested in making additions or
changes!

1. [ent](https://entgo.io/) - insane entity mapping tool, definitely not an ORM
   but kind of an ORM (handles our relational data storage, mappings, codegen
   processes)
1. [atlas](https://atlasgo.io/) - Schema generation and migrations (can be
   disabled in lieu of migrations on disk)
1. [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) - Secondary database migration
   utility we also use for seeding data
1. [gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com/) - Code generation + GraphQL server building
   from from `ent` schema definitions
1. [gqlgenc](https://github.com/Yamashou/gqlgenc) - Client building utilities
   with GraphQL
1. [openfga](https://openfga.dev/) - Flexible authorization/permission engine
   inspired by Google Zanzibar
1. [echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) - High performance, extensible, minimalist
   Go web framework
1. [koanf](https://github.com/knadh/koanf) - Configuration management library
   which parses command line arguments, Go structs + creates our main
   configuration files

We also leverage many secondary technologies in use, including (but not limited
to!):

1. [taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/usage/) - So much better than Make zomg
1. [redis](https://redis.io/) - in-memory datastore used for sessions, caching
1. [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
1. [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) - an annoyingly
   opinionated linter
1. [buildkite](https://buildkite.com/theopenlane) - our CI system of choice
   (with github actions providing some intermediary support)

All of these components are bundled into our respective Docker images; for
additional information / instructions, see the
[contributing guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) in this repository. We're
constantly adding and changing things, but have tried to list all the great open
source tools and projects we rely on; if you see your project (or one you use)
in here and wish to list it, feel free to open a PR!
