# Tuples for testing the FGA implementation
# This file is specific to workflow types:
#   - workflow_definition (user-managed)
#   - workflow_instance (system-driven)
#   - workflow_assignment (system-driven)
#   - workflow_object_ref (system-driven)
#   - workflow_assignment_target (system-driven)
#   - workflow_event (system-driven)
#   - workflow_proposal (system-driven)
#
# Note: Only workflow_definition has editor relations.
# All other workflow types are system-driven (only services can edit/delete).
