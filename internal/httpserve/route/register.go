This endpoint requires a 'strong' password and a valid register request, otherwise a 400 reply is returned. The password is stored in the database as an argon2 derived key so it is impossible for a hacker to get access to raw passwords. A personal organization is created for the user registering based on the organization data in the register request and the user is assigned the Owner role",
