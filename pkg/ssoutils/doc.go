// Package ssoutils provides helper functionality for OIDC-based SSO integration, helping to bridge the gap between our choices on HTTP Server, token issuance, and overall SSO flow
// Several of the functions in this package are used to generate URLs for SSO login and callback due to limitations within echox not allowing for easy access to route paths
