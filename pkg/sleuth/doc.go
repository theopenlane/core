// Package sleuth performs a number of reconnaissance activities against a set of domains and urls. It is designed to be used / consumed as a package and contains many generic wrappers and functional options which make it easier to use the combination of upstream opensource tools leveraged in the project such as projectdisocvery's httpx, naabu, nmap, and katana. The package is designed to be used in conjunction with other subpackages within the sleuth package, such as dnsx, sub, ports, and spider, to provide a comprehensive analysis of domains, subdomains, records, certificates, associated urls used in conjunction with the domain (discovered via probing techniques)
