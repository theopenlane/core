# Bash

I got tired of running a bunch of manual commands in the console and comparing the output, and bash was like 20 seconds to spit out which offered an easy analysis / comparison to the output I was getting from wrapping the go packages

don't use it for anything other than local fuckery !

## Templates

the templates + nuclei scans are roughly what all the subpackages in go are supposed to be doing, so it's a useful comparison
