# Entitlements Catalog

`go run pkg/catalog/genjsonschema/catalog_schema.go` -> generates a jsonschema from the structs inside of catalog.go.

This jsonschema is how we validate that the yaml input is indeed valid and coforms to the specification. The `LoadCatalog` function will fail if the yaml input does not conform to the schema specification, offering some guardrails in the event of misconfiguration / bad yaml / missing fields, etc.

` go run ./cmd/catalog --stripe-key="[insertstrpekey]"` will take the catalog file, pull products and prices from stripe, and prompt you as to whether or not:
- the definitions in your catalog file have corresponding products and prices in the stripe instance matching the key you provided
-


```bash
➜  core git:(feat-modules) ✗ go run ./cmd/catalog --stripe-key=""
module trust_center         product:false missing_prices:2
module base                 product:false missing_prices:1
module compliance           product:true missing_prices:1
addon domain_scanning      product:false missing_prices:2
Create missing products and prices? (y/N):
```

After you've selected `y` to create the missing products and prices, you'll see an output in your terminal and you can confirm in the Stripe UI product catalog that the products and prices were created successfully. The way you can easily distinguish which products and prices were created through this process is by looking for the `managed_by` metadata and seeing that the `managed_by` includes `module-manager`. The goal of this piece of metadata is work similarly to how kubernetes controllers (and other systems) work where they use annotations / labels to indicate that the resource is controlled declaratively. This helps create the distinction between products or prices that were created manually, and helps prevent drift of products and prices which may have been manually changed in the system and do not match the declarative configuration.


```bash
➜  core git:(feat-modules) ✗ go run ./cmd/catalog --stripe-key=""
module base                 product:true missing_prices:0
module compliance           product:true missing_prices:0
module trust_center         product:true missing_prices:2
addon domain_scanning      product:false missing_prices:2
Create missing products and prices? (y/N):

```

If there are already matching prices in the system which share a lookupkey but do NOT have the managed metadata, you will be prompted as to whether or not you want to "take over" management of these resources. The implication being that not only will the metadata be updated, but if the price's product association does not match the declarative file, it will be changed

```bash
➜  core git:(feat-modules) ✗ go run ./cmd/catalog --stripe-key=""
module base                 product:true missing_prices:0
module compliance           product:true missing_prices:0
module trust_center         product:true missing_prices:0
addon domain_scanning      product:false missing_prices:2
┌──────────────┬────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┬─────────┐
│ FEATURE      │ LOOKUP KEY                 │ PRICE ID                       │ MANAGED │

└──────────────┴────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┴─────────┘

Take over these prices by adding metadata? (y/N):
```

Once you've successfully reconciled the products and prices in an instance, you should be able to re-run the command and see there are no actions which need to be taken. If, however, you don't have any products or prices which need updated but do NOT have the price ID included inside of the catalog, the default behavior is to write back to the catalog file to ensure the price ID's are included.

```bash
➜  core git:(feat-modules) ✗ go run ./cmd/catalog --stripe-key=""
module base                 product:true missing_prices:0
module compliance           product:true missing_prices:0
module trust_center         product:true missing_prices:0
addon domain_scanning      product:true missing_prices:0
```

If you didn't have price ID's already inside, you should see something like this in your git diff:

```bash

-          unit_amount: 10000
-          nickname: price_compliance_month

## Creating webhook endpoints

Use `CreateWebhookEndpoint` to programmatically register a webhook URL with Stripe. Provide the URL and the events you want delivered. The call returns the created endpoint including the signing secret that should be used to verify incoming requests.
