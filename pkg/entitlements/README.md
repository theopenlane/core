# Stripe integration

To test webhooks locally:

`brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe`

`stripe login` and then use your associated credentials

`stripe listen --forward-to localhost:17608/v1/stripe/webhook`

`stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded`

## Unprocessed

If your webhook endpoint temporarily canâ€™t process events, Stripe automatically resends the undelivered events to your endpoint for up to three days, increasing the time for your webhook endpoint to eventually receive and process all events.
