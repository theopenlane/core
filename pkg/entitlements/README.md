# Stripe integration

To test webhooks locally:

`brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe`

`stripe login` and then use your associated credentials

`stripe listen --forward-to localhost:17608/v1/stripe/webhook`

`stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded`

## Unprocessed

If your webhook endpoint temporarily canâ€™t process events, Stripe automatically resends the undelivered events to your endpoint for up to three days, increasing the time for your webhook endpoint to eventually receive and process all events.

stripe fixtures ./fixtures.json

stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded --override payment_intent:amount=5000 --override payment_intent:currency=usd --add payment_intent:customer=cus_xxx

## Subscription status

Basic information pulled up out of stripe's docs indicating the various scenarios in which a subscription can be in a given status

https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-status

### Active

- subscription moves into active status when trial ends and a payment method has been added
- if initial payment attempt fails, and moves into incomplete, but then the payment is successful, it moves into active
- if trial ends and no payment method has been added, subs moves into paused status; if payment method is added + processed, it moves back to active

### Incomplete

- a subscription moves into incomplete if the initial payment attempt fails

### IncompleteExpired

- if the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to incomplete_expired

### PastDue

- when collection_method=charge_automatically, subs becomes past_due when payment is required but cannot be paid (due to failed payment or awaiting additional user actions)

### Paused

- A subscription can only enter a paused status when a trial ends without a payment method

### Trialing

- subscription status is in trailing if we create the initial subscription with a trial period

### Canceled or Unpaid

- after exhausting all payment retry attempts, the subscription will become canceled or unpaid
- subscription moves into cancelled if we set cancel_at_period_end: true and the period end passes

## Redis cache

The CheckFeatureTuple function is responsible for determining whether a specific feature tuple exists, using a two-step approach: it first checks a Redis cache, and if the tuple is not found there, it queries an external FGA (Fine-Grained Authorization) system. This method is part of the TupleChecker struct, which holds references to a Redis client, an FGA client, and a cache time-to-live (TTL) duration.

The function begins by validating that both the Redis client and the FGA client are properly configured. If either is missing, it returns an error immediately, preventing further execution. Next, it generates a cache key based on the tuple's contents using the cacheKey method, which ensures that each tuple maps to a unique Redis key.

It then attempts to retrieve the tuple's existence status from Redis. If the key is found (err == nil), it returns true if the cached value is "1", or false otherwise. If the error is anything other than a cache miss (redis.Nil), it returns the error, as this indicates a problem with the Redis operation.

If the tuple is not present in the cache, the function queries the FGA system by calling CheckTuple. If this check fails, it returns the error. Otherwise, it caches the result in Redis for future requests, storing "1" for a positive result and "0" for a negative one, using the configured TTL. Finally, it returns the result of the FGA check.

This approach optimizes performance by reducing the number of expensive FGA checks, relying on Redis as a fast, in-memory cache. It also ensures that the cache is kept up-to-date with the latest results, improving efficiency for repeated queries. One subtlety is that the function does not handle errors from the Redis Set operation, which could be a point of improvement if cache consistency is critical.
