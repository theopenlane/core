## Evidence request list


## Control questions
Does the organization report sensitive/regulated data incidents in a timely manner?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to report sensitive/regulated data incidents in a timely manner.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to report sensitive/regulated data incidents in a timely manner.

### Planned and tracked
Incident Response (IRO) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Incident response operations are decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel:
o	Identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for incident response operations.
o	Implement and maintain an incident response capability using a documented and tested Incident Response Plan (IRP) to facilitate incident management operations that cover preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery.
- Administrative processes and technologies exist to document, manage and report on actual and potential cybersecurity & data privacy incidents.
- Administrative processes and technologies exist to maintain incident response contacts with applicable regulatory and law enforcement agencies.

### Well defined
Incident Response (IR) processes are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- An Integrated Security Incident Response Team (ISIRT), or similar function, exists to form an on-demand, scalable and integrated team of formally-assigned cybersecurity, IT, data privacy and business function representatives that can perform coordinated incident response.
- The ISIRT, or similar function, develops and maintains a documented, program-level Integrated Incident Response Program (IIRP) that provides operational and tactical-level guidance for cybersecurity & data privacy response operations.
- A Security Operations Center (SOC), or similar function, facilitates incident management operations that includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery.
- Business Process Owners (BPOs), in conjunction with the SOC and ISIRT functions, develop and maintain a documented Incident Response Plan (IRP) specific to the business process / business unit but inclusive of the organization's larger approach to incident response operations.
- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, categorizes endpoint devices according to the data the asset stores, transmits and/ or processes and provides that information to the SOC for Incident Response Operations (IRO).
- Administrative processes and technologies exist to report incidents both internally to organizational incident response personnel (within defined time-periods) and externally to governmental authorities and affected parties, as necessary.
- Administrative processes and technologies exist to maintain incident response contacts with applicable regulatory and law enforcement agencies.

### Quantitatively controlled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to report sensitive/regulated data incidents in a timely manner.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to report sensitive/regulated data incidents in a timely manner.
