## Evidence request list


## Control questions
Does the organization protect the system from information leakage due to electromagnetic signals emanations?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to protect the system from information leakage due to electromagnetic signals emanations.

### Performed internally
Physical & Environmental Security (PES) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Physical access control is decentralized.
- Physical security controls are primarily administrative in nature (e.g., policies & standards), focusing on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs).
- Human Resources, or a similar function, maintains a current list of personnel and facilitates the implementation of physical access management controls.
- Facility security mechanisms exist to protect the system from information leakage due to electromagnetic signals emanations.

### Planned and tracked
Physical & Environmental Security (PES) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Physical access control is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for physical access control.
- Human Resources, or a similar function, maintains a current list of personnel with authorized access to organizational facilities and facilitates the implementation of physical access management controls.
- Physical security controls are primarily administrative in nature (e.g., policies & standards).
- Physical controls, administrative processes and technologies are primarily designed and implemented for offices, rooms and facilities that focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed.
- A facilities maintenance team, or similar function, manages the operation of automated physical and environmental protection controls.
- Physical controls and technologies protect the system from information leakage due to electromagnetic signals emanations.

### Well defined
Physical & Environmental Security (PES) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- A physical security team, or similar function:
o	Performs the centralized-management of physical security controls across the enterprise.
o	Maintains a current list of personnel with authorized access to organizational facilities and implements physical access management controls.
- A facilities maintenance team, or similar function, manages the operation of environmental protection controls.
- Administrative processes exist to authorize physical access to facilities based on the position or role of the individual.
- Administrative processes and physical controls restrict unescorted access to facilities to personnel with required security clearances, formal access authorizations and validated the need for access.
- Physical controls and technologies protect the system from information leakage due to electromagnetic signals emanations.

### Quantitatively controlled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to protect the system from information leakage due to electromagnetic signals emanations.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to protect the system from information leakage due to electromagnetic signals emanations.
