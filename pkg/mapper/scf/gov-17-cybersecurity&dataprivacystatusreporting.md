## Evidence request list

## Control questions
Does the organization submit status reporting of the organization's cybersecurity and/or data privacy program to applicable statutory and/or regulatory authorities, as required?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to submit status reporting of the organization's cybersecurity and/or data privacy program to applicable statutory and/or regulatory authorities, as required.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to submit status reporting of the organization's cybersecurity and/or data privacy program to applicable statutory and/or regulatory authorities, as required.

### Planned and tracked
SP-CMM2 is N/A, since a well-defined process is required to submit status reporting of the organization's cybersecurity and/or data privacy program to applicable statutory and/or regulatory authorities, as required.

### Well defined
Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Statutory, regulatory and contractual compliance requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy are identified and documented. Recurring testing is utilized to assess adherence to internal standards and/or external compliance requirements.
- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides scoping guidance to determine control applicability.
- Internal policies and standards address all statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations for cybersecurity & data privacy.
- Controls are standardized across the organization to ensure uniformity and consistent execution.
- Corporate governance (executive oversight) exists for the cybersecurity and data privacy, which includes regular briefings to ensure executives have sufficient situational awareness to properly govern the organization.
- Procedures are established for sensitive/regulated compliance obligations that are standardized across the organization.
- Defined roles & responsibilities require data/process owners to define, implement and maintain cybersecurity & data privacy controls for each system, application and/ or service of which they have accountability.
- The organization designates one or more qualified individuals to govern the cybersecurity and data privacy programs (e.g., Chief Information Security Officer or Chief Privacy Officer).
- Risk management processes are defined, to include materiality considerations.

### Quantitatively controlled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to submit status reporting of the organization's cybersecurity and/or data privacy program to applicable statutory and/or regulatory authorities, as required.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to submit status reporting of the organization's cybersecurity and/or data privacy program to applicable statutory and/or regulatory authorities, as required.
