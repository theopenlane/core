# SCF - NET-01.1 - Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)
Mechanisms exist to treat all users and devices as potential threats and prevent access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.

## Evidence request list


## Control questions
Does the organization treat all users and devices as potential threats and prevent access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to treat all users and devices as potential threats and prevent access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to treat all users and devices as potential threats and prevent access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.

### Planned and tracked
SP-CMM2 is N/A, since a well-defined process is required to treat all users and devices as potential threats and prevent access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.

### Well defined
Network Security (NET) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- A Technology Infrastructure team, or similar function, defines centrally-managed network security controls for implementation across the enterprise.
- Secure engineering principles are used to design and implement network security controls (e.g., industry-recognized secure practices) to enforce the concepts of least privilege and least functionality at the network level.
- IT/cybersecurity architects work with the Technology Infrastructure team to implement a “layered defense” network architecture that provides a defense-in-depth approach for redundancy and risk reduction for network-based security controls, including wired and wireless networking.
- Administrative processes and technologies configure boundary devices (e.g., firewalls, routers, etc.) to deny network traffic by default and allow network traffic by exception (e.g., deny all, permit by exception).
- Technologies automate the Access Control Lists (ACLs) and similar rulesets review process to identify security issues and/ or misconfigurations.
- Network segmentation exists to implement separate network addresses (e.g., different subnets) to connect systems in different security domains (e.g., sensitive/regulated data environments).

### Quantitatively controlled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to treat all users and devices as potential threats and prevent access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to treat all users and devices as potential threats and prevent access to data and resources until the users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized.
