## Control questions
Does the organization provide a cybersecurity & data protection controls oversight function that reports to the organization's executive leadership?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to provide a cybersecurity & data privacy controls oversight function that reports to the organization's executive leadership.

### Performed internally
Compliance (CPL) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- IT personnel use an informal process to govern statutory, regulatory and contractual compliance obligations.
- IT personnel self-identify a set of controls that are used to conduct cybersecurity & data privacy control assessments.
- IT personnel perform internal assessments of cybersecurity & data privacy controls to determine compliance status.

### Planned and tracked
Compliance (CPL) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Compliance activities are decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for compliance activities.
- Cybersecurity personnel use a defined set of controls to conduct cybersecurity & data privacy control assessments, as defined by the applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements.
- Cybersecurity personnel generate a formal report for each security assessment to document the assessment of cybersecurity & data privacy controls.
- Compliance reporting is performed, as required.

### Well defined
Compliance (CPL) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to ensure compliance requirements are identified and documented.
- The GRC function, or similar function:
o	Ensures data/process owners understand their requirements to manage applicable cybersecurity & data privacy controls through oversight and written guidance.
o	Provides applicable stakeholders with status reports on control execution to enable security controls oversight.
o	Works with data/process owners and asset custodians to document and validate the scope of cybersecurity & data privacy controls to ensure statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations are met.
o	Conducts cybersecurity & data privacy control assessments, on a regular cadence that is defined by the applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements.
- Cybersecurity and data privacy controls are centrally managed through a technology solution (e.g., GRC solution) to assign controls, track control activities and report on compliance efforts.
- An Audit Committee, or similar function:
o	Reviews the findings from security assessments and oversees long-term remediation efforts, when applicable.
o	Provides senior leaders with insights into the appropriateness of the organization's technology and information governance processes through recurring audits on pertinent cybersecurity & data privacy-related topics.
o	Governs changes to compliance operations to ensure its stability, reliability and ongoing improvement.

### Quantitatively controlled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to provide a cybersecurity & data privacy controls oversight function that reports to the organization's executive leadership.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to provide a cybersecurity & data privacy controls oversight function that reports to the organization's executive leadership.
