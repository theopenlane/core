# SCF - THR-05 - Insider Threat Awareness
Mechanisms exist to utilize security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.
## Mapped framework controls
### NIST 800-53
- [AT-2(2)](../nist80053/at-2-2.md)

## Evidence request list


## Control questions
Does the organization utilize security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to utilize security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.

### Performed internally
Threat Management (THR) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Threat management is decentralized.
- IT personnel subscribe to threat feeds to maintain situational awareness of emerging threats.

### Planned and tracked
Threat Management (THR) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Threat management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- The HR department, in conjunction with cybersecurity personnel, helps ensure secure practices are implemented in personnel management operations to help manage threats.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel:
o	Identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for threat management.
o	Subscribe to threat feeds to maintain situational awareness of emerging threats.

### Well defined
Threat Management (THR) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- A Security Operations Center (SOC), or similar function:
o	Subscribes to threat feeds to maintain situational awareness of emerging threats.
o	Develops Indicators of Exposure (IOE) to better understand potential attack vectors that attackers could use to attack the organization.
o	Implements a Threat Awareness Program (TAP) that includes a cross-organization information-sharing capability.
o	Implements a “threat hunting” capability to actively identify internal threats.
- An Integrated Security Incident Response Team (ISIRT), or similar function, exists to form an on-demand, integrated team of cybersecurity, IT, data privacy and business function representatives that can execute coordinated incident response operations, including a cross-discipline incident handling capability.
- Cybersecurity personnel enable security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.

### Quantitatively controlled
Threat Management (THR) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to utilize security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.
