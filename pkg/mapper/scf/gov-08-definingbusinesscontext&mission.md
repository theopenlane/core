## Evidence request list
E-PRM-01

## Control questions
Does the organization define the context of its business model and document the mission of the organization?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to define the context of its business model and document the mission of the organization.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to define the context of its business model and document the mission of the organization.

### Planned and tracked
Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Cybersecurity and data privacy governance activities are decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy governance activities.
- The Chief Information Officer (CIO), or similar function, analyzes the organization's business strategy and prioritizes the objectives of the security function, based on business requirements.
- A qualified individual is assigned the role and responsibilities to centrally manage, coordinate, develop, implement and maintain a cybersecurity & data privacy program (e.g., cybersecurity director or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)).
- No formal Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) team exists. GRC roles are assigned to existing cybersecurity personnel.
- Compliance requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy are identified and documented.
- Cybersecurity policies and standards exist that are aligned with a leading cybersecurity framework (e.g., SCF, NIST 800-53, ISO 27002 or NIST Cybersecurity Framework).
- Controls are assigned to sensitive/regulated assets to comply with specific compliance requirements.
- Procedures are established for sensitive/regulated obligations, but are not standardized across the organization.
- Documentation is made available to internal personnel.

### Well defined
Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Statutory, regulatory and contractual compliance requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy are identified and documented. Recurring testing is utilized to assess adherence to internal standards and/or external compliance requirements.
- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides scoping guidance to determine control applicability.
- Internal policies and standards address all statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations for cybersecurity & data privacy.
- Controls are standardized across the organization to ensure uniformity and consistent execution.
- Corporate governance (executive oversight) exists for the cybersecurity and data privacy, which includes regular briefings to ensure executives have sufficient situational awareness to properly govern the organization.
- Procedures are established for sensitive/regulated compliance obligations that are standardized across the organization.
- Defined roles & responsibilities require data/process owners to define, implement and maintain cybersecurity & data privacy controls for each system, application and/ or service of which they have accountability.
- The organization designates one or more qualified individuals to govern the cybersecurity and data privacy programs (e.g., Chief Information Security Officer or Chief Privacy Officer).
- Risk management processes are defined, to include materiality considerations.

### Quantitatively controlled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to define the context of its business model and document the mission of the organization.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to define the context of its business model and document the mission of the organization.
