## Evidence request list


## Control questions
Does the organization conduct a risk assessment prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of technology-related services?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to conduct a risk assessment prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of technology-related services.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to conduct a risk assessment prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of technology-related services.

### Planned and tracked
Third-Party Management (TPM) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Third-party management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for third-party management.
- A procurement function maintains a list of all active Third-Party Service Providers (TSP), including pertinent contract information that will assist in a risk assessment.
- A Shared Responsibility Matrix (SRM) is documented for every TSP that directly or indirectly affects sensitive/regulated data.
- Procurement contracts:
o	Require TSP to follow secure engineering practices as part of a broader Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) initiative.
o	Contain "break clauses" in all TSP contracts to enable penalty-free, early termination of a contract for cause, based on the TSP's cybersecurity and/ or data privacy practices deficiency(ies).

### Well defined
Third-Party Management (TPM) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Procurement contracts and layered defenses provide safeguards to limit harm from potential adversaries who identify and target the organization's supply chain.
- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function;
o	provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization's applications, systems, services and data with regards to third-party management.
o	Operates the Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) program to identify and mitigate supply chain-related risks and threats.
o	Evaluates risks associated with weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements identified during first and/ or third-party reviews.
o	Enables the implementation of third-party management controls.
o	Ensures the Information Assurance Program (IAP) evaluates applicable cybersecurity & data privacy controls as part of “business as usual” pre-production testing.
- A procurement team, or similar function:
o	Maintains a list of all active Third-Party Service Providers (TSP), including pertinent contract information that will assist in a risk assessment.
o	Requires TSP to follow secure engineering practices as part of a broader Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) initiative.
o	Includes "break clauses" in all TSP contracts to enable penalty-free, early termination of a contract for cause, based on the TSP's cybersecurity and/ or data privacy practices deficiency(ies).
o	Controls changes to services by suppliers, taking into account the criticality of business information, systems and processes that are in scope by the third-party.
o	Requires a risk assessment prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of technology-related services.
o	Monitors, regularly reviews and audits supplier service delivery for compliance with established contract agreements.
o	Uses tailored acquisition strategies, contract tools and procurement methods for the purchase of unique systems, system components or services.
- A Shared Responsibility Matrix (SRM) is documented for every TSP that directly or indirectly affects sensitive/regulated data.

### Quantitatively controlled
Third-Party Management (TPM) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to conduct a risk assessment prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of technology-related services.
