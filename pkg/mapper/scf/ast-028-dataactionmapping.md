## Control questions
Does the organization create and maintain a map of technology assets where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted or processed?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to create and maintain a map of technology assets where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted or processed.

### Performed internally
Asset Management (AST) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Asset management is informally assigned as an additional duty to existing IT/cybersecurity personnel.
- Asset inventories are performed in an ad hoc manner.
- Software licensing is tracked as part of IT asset inventories.
- Data process owners maintain limited network diagrams to document the flow of sensitive/regulated data that is specific to their initiative.
- IT personnel work with data/process owners to help ensure secure practices are implemented throughout the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for all high-value projects.

### Planned and tracked
Asset Management (AST) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Asset management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for asset management.
- Administrative processes and technologies focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed.
- Asset management is formally assigned as an additional duty to existing IT/cybersecurity personnel.
- Technology assets are categorized according to data classification and business criticality.
- Inventories cover technology assets in scope for statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance, which includes both physical and virtual assets.
- Software licensing is tracked as part of IT asset inventories.
- Users are educated on their responsibilities to protect technology assets assigned to them or under their supervision.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel maintain network diagrams to document the flow of sensitive/regulated data across the network.
-  on at least an annual basis, or after any major technology or process change, the data/process owner updates the data mapping documentation.

### Well defined
Asset Management (AST) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, governs asset management to help ensure compliance with requirements for asset management.
- An ITAM function, or similar function, maintains an inventory of IT assets, covering both physical and virtual assets, as well as centrally managed asset ownership assignments.
- Technology assets and data are categorized according to data classification and business criticality criteria.
- A Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) function oversees supply chain risks including the removal and prevention of certain technology services and/ or equipment designated as supply chain threats by a statutory or regulatory body.
- Data/process owners document where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed, generating Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and network diagrams to document the flow of data.
-  on at least an annual basis, or after any major technology or process change, the data/process owner updates any data mapping documentation.
- A Data Protection Officer (DPO) maintains a centralized repository of personal data mapping, as well as sensitive/regulated data flows.

### Quantitatively controlled
Asset Management (AST) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement.
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to create and maintain a map of technology assets where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted or processed.
