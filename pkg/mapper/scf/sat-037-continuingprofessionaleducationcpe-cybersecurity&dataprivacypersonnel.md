## Control questions
Does the organization ensure cybersecurity & data privacy personnel receive Continuing Professional Education (CPE) training to maintain currency and proficiency with industry-recognized secure practices that are pertinent to their assigned roles and responsibilities?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to ensure cybersecurity & data privacy personnel receive Continuing Professional Education (CPE) training to maintain currency and proficiency with industry-recognized secure practices that are pertinent to their assigned roles and responsibilities.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to ensure cybersecurity & data privacy personnel receive Continuing Professional Education (CPE) training to maintain currency and proficiency with industry-recognized secure practices that are pertinent to their assigned roles and responsibilities.

### Planned and tracked
SP-CMM2 is N/A, since a well-defined process is required to ensure cybersecurity & data privacy personnel receive Continuing Professional Education (CPE) training to maintain currency and proficiency with industry-recognized secure practices that are pertinent to their assigned roles and responsibilities.

### Well defined
Security Awareness & Training (SAT) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function:
o	Provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization's applications, systems, services and data with regards to security awareness and training.
o	Defines minimum cybersecurity training (including certifications) for personnel, based on their specific roles.
o	Creates/governs security and awareness training to meet specific statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations.
- A steering committee is formally established to provide executive oversight of the cybersecurity & data privacy program, including security awareness and training.
- Security awareness and training methods are role-based (e.g., handling sensitive/regulated data).
- The Human Resources (HR) department:
o	Identifies and implements industry-recognized HR practices related to security workforce development and awareness to help ensure secure practices are implemented in personnel management operations.
o	Documents, retains and monitors individual training activities, including basic security awareness training, ongoing awareness training and specific-system training.
o	Ensures that every user accessing a system processing, storing or transmitting sensitive/regulated data is formally trained in data handling requirements.
o	Ensures all employees and contractors receive awareness education and training that is relevant for their job function, including social engineering-related threats.
- Cybersecurity and/ or data privacy personnel receive necessary Continuing Professional Education (CPE) training to maintain currency and proficiency with industry-recognized secure practices pertinent to their assigned roles and responsibilities.

### Quantitatively controlled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to ensure cybersecurity & data privacy personnel receive Continuing Professional Education (CPE) training to maintain currency and proficiency with industry-recognized secure practices that are pertinent to their assigned roles and responsibilities.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to ensure cybersecurity & data privacy personnel receive Continuing Professional Education (CPE) training to maintain currency and proficiency with industry-recognized secure practices that are pertinent to their assigned roles and responsibilities.
