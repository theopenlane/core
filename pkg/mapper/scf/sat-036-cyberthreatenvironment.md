# SCF - SAT-03.6 - Cyber Threat Environment
Mechanisms exist to provide role-based cybersecurity & data privacy awareness training that is current and relevant to the cyber threats that users might encounter in day-to-day business operations.
## Mapped framework controls
### SOC 2

## Evidence request list
E-SAT-04

## Control questions
Does the organization provide role-based cybersecurity & data privacy awareness training that is current and relevant to the cyber threats that users might encounter in day-to-day business operations?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to provide role-based cybersecurity & data privacy awareness training that is current and relevant to the cyber threats that users might encounter in day-to-day business operations.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to provide role-based cybersecurity & data privacy awareness training that is current and relevant to the cyber threats that users might encounter in day-to-day business operations.

### Planned and tracked
Security Awareness & Training (SAT) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Training and awareness activities are decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and use non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- The Human Resources (HR) department works with cybersecurity personnel to facilitate workforce development and awareness to help ensure secure practices are implemented.
- Security awareness and training methods are role-based (e.g., handling sensitive/regulated data).
- IT/cybersecurity personnel:
o	Identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for security training and awareness activities.
o	Create/govern security and awareness training to meet specific statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations.
o	Self-manage their professional certification requirements to support their assigned duties.

### Well defined
Security Awareness & Training (SAT) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function:
o	Provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization's applications, systems, services and data with regards to security awareness and training.
o	Defines minimum cybersecurity training (including certifications) for personnel, based on their specific roles.
o	Creates/governs security and awareness training to meet specific statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations.
- A steering committee is formally established to provide executive oversight of the cybersecurity & data privacy program, including security awareness and training.
- Security awareness and training methods are role-based (e.g., handling sensitive/regulated data).
- The Human Resources (HR) department:
o	Identifies and implements industry-recognized HR practices related to security workforce development and awareness to help ensure secure practices are implemented in personnel management operations.
o	Documents, retains and monitors individual training activities, including basic security awareness training, ongoing awareness training and specific-system training.
o	Ensures that every user accessing a system processing, storing or transmitting sensitive/regulated data is formally trained in data handling requirements.
o	Ensures all employees and contractors receive awareness education and training that is relevant for their job function, including social engineering-related threats.

### Quantitatively controlled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to provide role-based cybersecurity & data privacy awareness training that is current and relevant to the cyber threats that users might encounter in day-to-day business operations.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to provide role-based cybersecurity & data privacy awareness training that is current and relevant to the cyber threats that users might encounter in day-to-day business operations.
