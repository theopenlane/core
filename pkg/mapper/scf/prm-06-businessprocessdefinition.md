# SCF - PRM-06 - Business Process Definition
Mechanisms exist to define business processes with consideration for cybersecurity & data privacy that determines:
 - The resulting risk to organizational operations, assets, individuals and other organizations; and
 - Information protection needs arising from the defined business processes and revises the processes as necessary, until an achievable set of protection needs is obtained.

## Evidence request list
E-PRM-03

## Control questions
Does the organization define business processes with consideration for cybersecurity & data privacy that determines:
 •The resulting risk to organizational operations, assets, individuals and other organizations; and
 •Information protection needs arising from the defined business processes and revises the processes as necessary, until an achievable set of protection needs is obtained?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to define business processes with consideration for cybersecurity & data privacy that determines:
 •The resulting risk to organizational operations, assets, individuals and other organizations; and
 •Information protection needs arising from the defined business processes and revises the processes as necessary, until an achievable set of protection needs is obtained.

### Performed internally
Project & Resource Management (PRM) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Program/project management is decentralized.
- IT personnel work with data/process owners to help ensure secure practices are implemented throughout the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for all high-value projects.

### Planned and tracked
Project & Resource Management (PRM) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Program/project management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for Project Management (PM).
- The PM function facilitates the implementation of cybersecurity & data privacy-related resource planning controls across the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for all projects.
- The responsibility for enforcing cybersecurity & data privacy control implementation is assigned to business / process owners and asset custodians.

### Well defined
Project & Resource Management (PRM) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), or similar function with technical competence to address cybersecurity concerns, analyzes the organization's business strategy to determine prioritized and authoritative guidance for program/project management practices.
- The CISO, or similar function, develops a security-focused Concept of Operations (CONOPS) that documents management, operational and technical measures to apply defense-in-depth techniques across the enterprise with regards to program/project management.
- The CISO, or similar function, leverages a capability maturity model to define and identify targeted capability maturity levels for each of the functions that make up the cybersecurity & data privacy program.
- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization's applications, systems, services and data for program/project management.
- A steering committee is formally established to provide executive oversight of the cybersecurity & data privacy program, including program/project management.
- A Project Management Office (PMO), or project management function, enables the centralized-implementation of cybersecurity & data privacy-related resource planning controls across the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for all projects.
- The PMO determines the identification and allocation of resources for cybersecurity & data privacy requirements within business process planning for projects and other initiatives.
- Project Management (PM) is centrally-managed across the enterprise to implement cybersecurity & data privacy controls as part of the project management lifecycle, with the responsibility for enforcing cybersecurity & data privacy control implementation assigned to business / process owners and asset custodians.
- Subordinate staff and stakeholders are educated on the capability maturity expectations and those targets are used to task individual contributor work activities in an effort to achieve the targeted maturity levels.

### Quantitatively controlled
Project & Resource Management (PRM) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to define business processes with consideration for cybersecurity & data privacy that determines:
 •The resulting risk to organizational operations, assets, individuals and other organizations; and
 •Information protection needs arising from the defined business processes and revises the processes as necessary, until an achievable set of protection needs is obtained.
