## Control questions
Does the organization ensure control applicability is appropriately-determined for systems, applications, services and third parties by graphically representing applicable boundaries?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to ensure control applicability is appropriately-determined for systems, applications, services and third parties by graphically representing applicable boundaries.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to ensure control applicability is appropriately-determined for systems, applications, services and third parties by graphically representing applicable boundaries.

### Planned and tracked
SP-CMM2 is N/A, since a well-defined process is required to ensure control applicability is appropriately-determined for systems, applications, services and third parties by graphically representing applicable boundaries.

### Well defined
Asset Management (AST) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, governs asset management to help ensure compliance with requirements for asset management.
- An ITAM function, or similar function, maintains an inventory of IT assets, covering both physical and virtual assets, as well as centrally managed asset ownership assignments.
- Technology assets and data are categorized according to data classification and business criticality criteria.
- A Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) function oversees supply chain risks including the removal and prevention of certain technology services and/ or equipment designated as supply chain threats by a statutory or regulatory body.
- Data/process owners document where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed, generating Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and network diagrams to document the flow of data.
- Stakeholders create network diagrams that graphically represent compliance boundaries (e.g., in-scope vs out-of-scope).

### Quantitatively controlled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to ensure control applicability is appropriately-determined for systems, applications, services and third parties by graphically representing applicable boundaries.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to ensure control applicability is appropriately-determined for systems, applications, services and third parties by graphically representing applicable boundaries.
