# SCF - TDA-09 - Cybersecurity & Data Privacy Testing Throughout Development
Mechanisms exist to require system developers/integrators consult with cybersecurity & data privacy personnel to:
 - Create and implement a Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E) plan;
 - Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process to correct weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the security testing and evaluation process; and
 - Document the results of the security testing/evaluation and flaw remediation processes.

## Control questions
Does the organization require system developers/integrators consult with cybersecurity & data privacy personnel to:
 •Create and implement a Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E) plan;
 •Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process to correct weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the security testing and evaluation process; and
 •Document the results of the security testing/evaluation and flaw remediation processes?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to require system developers/integrators consult with cybersecurity & data privacy personnel to:
 •Create and implement a Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E) plan;
 •Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process to correct weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the security testing and evaluation process; and
 •Document the results of the security testing/evaluation and flaw remediation processes.

### Performed internally
Technology Development & Acquisition (TDA) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- IT personnel use an informal process to govern technology development and acquisition.
- Secure development practices loosely conform to industry-recognized standards for secure engineering (e.g., OWASP, NIST SP 800-218, NIST SP 800-160, etc.).
- IT personnel work with data/process owners to help ensure secure practices are implemented throughout the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for all high-value projects.

### Planned and tracked
Technology Development & Acquisition (TDA) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Development and acquisition management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for technology development and acquisition management.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel implement secure practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization's technology assets, data and network(s).
- Secure development practices mostly conform to industry-recognized standards for secure engineering (e.g., OWASP, NIST SP 800-218, NIST SP 800-160, etc.).
- Procurement practices require third-party developers of systems, system components or services to follow secure engineering practices.
- A Project Management Office (PMO), or project management function, enables the implementation of cybersecurity & data privacy-related resource planning controls across the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for all high-value projects.

### Well defined
Technology Development & Acquisition (TDA) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Secure development practices conform to industry-recognized standards for secure engineering (e.g., OWASP, NIST SP 800-218, NIST SP 800-160, etc.).
- A procurement team, or similar function, ensures that third party development and/ or acquisitions meet, or exceed, the organization's business, cybersecurity & data privacy requirements to have secure and resilient systems, applications, services and processes.
- A Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) governs a secure development lifecycle for the development of systems, applications and services.
- Administrative processes exist and technologies are configured to implement secure configuration settings by default to reduce the likelihood of software being deployed with weak security settings, putting the asset at a greater risk of compromise.
- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, categorizes devices according to the data the asset stores, transmits and/ or processes and applies the appropriate technology controls to protect the asset and data.
- A formal Change Management (CM) program help to ensure that no unauthorized changes are made, all changes are documented, services are not disrupted and resources are used efficiently.
- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function;
o	Provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization's applications, systems, services and data for technology development and acquisition.
o	Ensures the Information Assurance Program (IAP) evaluates applicable cybersecurity & data privacy controls as part of “business as usual” pre-production testing.
o	Operates the Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) program to identify and mitigate supply chain-related risks and threats.
- A Project Management Office (PMO), or project management function, enables IAP pre-production testing of cybersecurity & data privacy controls as part of the organization's established project management processes.

### Quantitatively controlled
Technology Development & Acquisition (TDA) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to require system developers/integrators consult with cybersecurity & data privacy personnel to:
 •Create and implement a Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E) plan;
 •Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process to correct weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the security testing and evaluation process; and
 •Document the results of the security testing/evaluation and flaw remediation processes.
