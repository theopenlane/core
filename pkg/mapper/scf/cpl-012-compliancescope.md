# SCF - CPL-01.2 - Compliance Scope
Mechanisms exist to document and validate the scope of cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are determined to meet statutory, regulatory and/or contractual compliance obligations.

## Control questions
Does the organization document and validate the scope of cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are determined to meet statutory, regulatory and/or contractual compliance obligations?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to document and validate the scope of cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are determined to meet statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to document and validate the scope of cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are determined to meet statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations.

### Planned and tracked
Compliance (CPL) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Compliance activities are decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for compliance activities.
- Cybersecurity personnel use a defined set of controls to conduct cybersecurity & data privacy control assessments, as defined by the applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements.
- Data process owners and asset custodians are responsible for performing compliance scoping of control applicability for statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations.

### Well defined
Compliance (CPL) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to ensure compliance requirements are identified and documented.
- The GRC function, or similar function:
o	Ensures data/process owners understand their requirements to manage applicable cybersecurity & data privacy controls through oversight and written guidance.
o	Provides applicable stakeholders with status reports on control execution to enable security controls oversight.
o	Works with data/process owners and asset custodians to document and validate the scope of cybersecurity & data privacy controls to ensure statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations are met.
o	Conducts cybersecurity & data privacy control assessments, on a regular cadence that is defined by the applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements.
- Cybersecurity and data privacy controls are centrally managed through a technology solution (e.g., GRC solution) to assign controls, track control activities and report on compliance efforts.
- GRC personnel assist data process owners and asset custodians with performing compliance scoping of control applicability for statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations.

### Quantitatively controlled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to document and validate the scope of cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are determined to meet statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to document and validate the scope of cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are determined to meet statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations.
