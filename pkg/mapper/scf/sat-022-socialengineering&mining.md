# SCF - SAT-02.2 - Social Engineering & Mining
Mechanisms exist to include awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential and actual instances of social engineering and social mining.
## Mapped framework controls
### NIST 800-53
- [AT-2(3)](../nist80053/at-2-3.md)

## Evidence request list
E-SAT-02

## Control questions
Does the organization include awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential and actual instances of social engineering and social mining?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to include awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential and actual instances of social engineering and social mining.

### Performed internally
Security Awareness & Training (SAT) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Training activities are decentralized.
- Security awareness and training methods are often generic, without organization-specific content.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel self-manage their professional certification requirements to support their assigned duties.
- Personnel management is mainly decentralized, with the responsibility for training users on new technologies and enforcing policies being assigned to usersâ€™ supervisors and managers.

### Planned and tracked
Security Awareness & Training (SAT) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Training and awareness activities are decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and use non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- The Human Resources (HR) department works with cybersecurity personnel to facilitate workforce development and awareness to help ensure secure practices are implemented.
- Security awareness and training methods are role-based (e.g., handling sensitive/regulated data).
- IT/cybersecurity personnel:
o	Identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for security training and awareness activities.
o	Create/govern security and awareness training to meet specific statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations.
o	Self-manage their professional certification requirements to support their assigned duties.

### Well defined
Security Awareness & Training (SAT) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function:
o	Provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization's applications, systems, services and data with regards to security awareness and training.
o	Defines minimum cybersecurity training (including certifications) for personnel, based on their specific roles.
o	Creates/governs security and awareness training to meet specific statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations.
- A steering committee is formally established to provide executive oversight of the cybersecurity & data privacy program, including security awareness and training.
- Security awareness and training methods are role-based (e.g., handling sensitive/regulated data).
- The Human Resources (HR) department:
o	Identifies and implements industry-recognized HR practices related to security workforce development and awareness to help ensure secure practices are implemented in personnel management operations.
o	Documents, retains and monitors individual training activities, including basic security awareness training, ongoing awareness training and specific-system training.
o	Ensures that every user accessing a system processing, storing or transmitting sensitive/regulated data is formally trained in data handling requirements.
o	Ensures all employees and contractors receive awareness education and training that is relevant for their job function, including social engineering-related threats.

### Quantitatively controlled
Security Awareness & Training (SAT) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to include awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential and actual instances of social engineering and social mining.
