# SCF - AST-02.9 - Configuration Management Database (CMDB)
Mechanisms exist to implement and manage a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), or similar technology, to monitor and govern technology asset-specific information.
## Mapped framework controls
### ISO 27002
- [A.8.9](../iso27002/a-8.md#a89)

## Evidence request list


## Control questions
Does the organization implement and manage a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), or similar technology, to monitor and govern technology asset-specific information?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to implement and manage a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), or similar technology, to monitor and govern technology asset-specific information.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to implement and manage a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), or similar technology, to monitor and govern technology asset-specific information.

### Planned and tracked
SP-CMM2 is N/A, since a well-defined process is required to implement and manage a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), or similar technology, to monitor and govern technology asset-specific information.

### Well defined
Asset Management (AST) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, governs asset management to help ensure compliance with requirements for asset management.
- An ITAM function, or similar function, maintains an inventory of IT assets, covering both physical and virtual assets, as well as centrally managed asset ownership assignments.
- Technology assets and data are categorized according to data classification and business criticality criteria.
- A Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) function oversees supply chain risks including the removal and prevention of certain technology services and/ or equipment designated as supply chain threats by a statutory or regulatory body.
- Data/process owners document where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed, generating Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and network diagrams to document the flow of data.
- ITAM leverages an established Configuration Management Database (CMDB), or similar tool, as the authoritative source of IT assets and user assignment.
- An IT infrastructure team, or similar function, ensures that statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls are addressed to ensure secure configurations are designed, built and maintained.
- Configurations conform to industry-recognized standards for hardening (e.g., DISA STIGs, CIS Benchmarks or OEM security guides) for test, development, staging and production environments.

### Quantitatively controlled
Asset Management (AST) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement.
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to implement and manage a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), or similar technology, to monitor and govern technology asset-specific information.
