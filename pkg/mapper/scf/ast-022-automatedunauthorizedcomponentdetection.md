# SCF - AST-02.2 - Automated Unauthorized Component Detection
Automated mechanisms exist to detect and alert upon the detection of unauthorized hardware, software and firmware components.
## Mapped framework controls
### NIST 800-53
- [CM-8(3)](../nist80053/cm-8-3.md)

### SOC 2
- [CC7.1-POF4](../soc2/cc71-pof4.md)

## Evidence request list


## Control questions
Does the organization use automated mechanisms to detect and alert upon the detection of unauthorized hardware, software and firmware components?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to detect and alert up on the detection of unauthorized hardware, software and firmware components.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to detect and alert up on the detection of unauthorized hardware, software and firmware components.

### Planned and tracked
SP-CMM2 is N/A, since a well-defined process is required to detect and alert up on the detection of unauthorized hardware, software and firmware components.

### Well defined
Asset Management (AST) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, governs asset management to help ensure compliance with requirements for asset management.
- An ITAM function, or similar function, maintains an inventory of IT assets, covering both physical and virtual assets, as well as centrally managed asset ownership assignments.
- Technology assets and data are categorized according to data classification and business criticality criteria.
- A Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) function oversees supply chain risks including the removal and prevention of certain technology services and/ or equipment designated as supply chain threats by a statutory or regulatory body.
- Data/process owners document where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed, generating Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and network diagrams to document the flow of data.
- The ITAM tool is configured to detect and alert on instances of duplication, unauthorized components and unauthorized software.
- Unauthorized configuration changes are responded to in accordance with an Incident Response Plan (IRP) to determine if the change is malicious in nature.

### Quantitatively controlled
Asset Management (AST) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement.
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to detect and alert up on the detection of unauthorized hardware, software and firmware components.
