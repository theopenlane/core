# SCF - MNT-03 - Timely Maintenance
Mechanisms exist to obtain maintenance support and/or spare parts for systems within a defined Recovery Time Objective (RTO).
## Mapped framework controls
### ISO 27002

### NIST 800-53

## Evidence request list
E-MNT-04

## Control questions
Does the organization obtain maintenance support and/or spare parts for systems within a defined Recovery Time Objective (RTO)?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to obtain maintenance support and/ or spare parts for systems within a defined Recovery Time Objective (RTO).

### Performed internally
Maintenance (MNT) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- IT personnel use an informal process to implement secure and timely technology asset-specific maintenance operations, including preventative and reactive maintenance operations.
- Facilities management uses an informal process to facilitate the secure and timely implementation of non-IT maintenance operations, including preventative and reactive maintenance operations.
- Maintenance operations are decentralized both in terms of change management and execution.
- Maintenance controls are primarily administrative in nature (e.g., policies & standards) to manage change control processes associated with maintenance operations.

### Planned and tracked
Maintenance (MNT) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Technology asset maintenance is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel:
o	Identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to appropriately address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for technology asset maintenance.
o	Develop and disseminate formal guidance to facilitate a localized/regionalized process to implement secure and timely technology asset-specific maintenance operations, including preventative and reactionary maintenance operations.
- Maintenance controls are primarily administrative in nature (e.g., policies & standards) to manage change control processes associated with maintenance operations.
- Asset custodians develop and maintain formalized procedures to conduct controlled and timely maintenance activities throughout the lifecycle of the system, application or service.
- Maintenance operations may be centralized for certain locations (e.g., datacenters) and decentralized for other locations, both in terms of change management and execution.
- Facilities management uses a localized/regionalized process to facilitate the secure and timely implementation of non-IT maintenance operations, including preventative and reactionary maintenance operations.

### Well defined
Maintenance (MNT) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- IT/cybersecurity personnel develop and disseminate formal practices to implement enterprise-wide capability to conduct secure and timely technology asset-specific maintenance operations, including preventative and reactionary maintenance operations.
- Technology asset-related maintenance operations are centralized in terms of change management and governance. Local/regional practices fall under the broader enterprise-wide technology asset maintenance program.
- Facilities management uses an enterprise-wide process to facilitate the secure and timely implementation of non-IT maintenance operations, including preventative and reactionary maintenance operations. Local/regional practices fall under the broader enterprise-wide facilities management program.
- A Change Control Board (CCB), or similar function, centrally manages the process of IT and non-IT maintenance operations to reduce the chance of business interruptions from maintenance operations.

### Quantitatively controlled
Maintenance (MNT) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to obtain maintenance support and/ or spare parts for systems within a defined Recovery Time Objective (RTO).
