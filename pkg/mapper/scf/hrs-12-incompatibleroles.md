# SCF - HRS-12 - Incompatible Roles
Mechanisms exist to avoid incompatible development-specific roles through limiting and reviewing developer privileges to change hardware, software and firmware components within a production/operational environment.
## Mapped framework controls
### ISO 27002
- [A.5.3](../iso27002/a-5.md#a53)

## Evidence request list
E-HRS-25

## Control questions
Does the organization avoid incompatible development-specific roles through limiting and reviewing developer privileges to change hardware, software and firmware components within a production/operational environment?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to avoid incompatible development-specific roles through limiting and reviewing developer privileges to change hardware, software and firmware components within a production/operational environment.

### Performed internally
Human Resources Security (HRS) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Personnel management is decentralized, with the responsibility for training users and enforcing policies being assigned to the user’s immediate supervisor(s)/manager(s), including the definition and enforcement of the user’s specific role(s) and responsibilities.
- The Human Resources (HR) department provides guidance on HR practices for hiring, retaining and terminating employees, contractors and other personnel that work on behalf of the organization.
- Terms of employment, including acceptable and unacceptable rules of behavior for the use of technologies, including consequences for unacceptable behavior are at the discretion of users’ management.
- Administrative processes require all employees and contractors to apply cybersecurity & data privacy principles in their daily work.

### Planned and tracked
Human Resources Security (HRS) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Personnel management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for personnel management.
- The Human Resources (HR) department:
o	Ensures industry-recognized HR practices are implemented for hiring, managing, training, investigating and terminating employees, contractors and other personnel that work on behalf of the organization.
o	Defines terms of employment, including acceptable and unacceptable rules of behavior for the use of technologies, including consequences for unacceptable behavior.
- The responsibility for training users and enforcing policies being assigned to user’s immediate supervisor(s)/manager(s), including the definition and enforcement of the user’s specific role(s) and responsibilities.
- Personnel managers ensure personnel are routinely made aware of the organization's cybersecurity / data privacy policies and provide acknowledgement.
- Administrative processes require all employees and contractors to apply cybersecurity & data privacy principles in their daily work.
- Administrative processes avoid incompatible development-specific roles through limiting and reviewing developer privileges to change hardware, software and firmware components within a production/operational environment.
- Administrative processes implement and maintain Separation of Duties (SoD) to prevent potential malevolent activity without collusion.

### Well defined
Human Resources Security (HRS) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- The Human Resources (HR) department:
o	Ensures industry-recognized HR practices are implemented for hiring, managing, training, investigating and terminating employees, contractors and other personnel that work on behalf of the organization.
o	Ensures that every user accessing a system that processes, stores, or transmits sensitive/regulated data is cleared and regularly trained in proper data handling practices.
o	Identifies and implements industry-recognized HR practices related to cybersecurity & data privacy training and awareness to help ensure secure practices are implemented in personnel operations to help manage risk to both technology assets and data.
o	Manages personnel security risk by assigning a risk designation to all positions and establishing screening criteria for individuals filling those positions.
- Administrative processes require Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) or similar confidentiality agreements that reflect the needs to protect data and operational details, for both employees and third-parties.
- Administrative processes avoid incompatible development-specific roles through limiting and reviewing developer privileges to change hardware, software and firmware components within a production/operational environment.
- Administrative processes implement and maintain Separation of Duties (SoD) to prevent potential malevolent activity without collusion.

### Quantitatively controlled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to avoid incompatible development-specific roles through limiting and reviewing developer privileges to change hardware, software and firmware components within a production/operational environment.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to avoid incompatible development-specific roles through limiting and reviewing developer privileges to change hardware, software and firmware components within a production/operational environment.
