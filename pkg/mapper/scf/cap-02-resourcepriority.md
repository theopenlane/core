# SCF - CAP-02 - Resource Priority
Mechanisms exist to control resource utilization of systems that are susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to limit and prioritize the use of resources.
## Mapped framework controls
### NIST 800-53
- [SC-5](../nist80053/sc-5.md)

### SOC 2
- [A1.1](../soc2/a11.md)

## Evidence request list


## Control questions
Does the organization control resource utilization of systems that are susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to limit and prioritize the use of resources?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to control resource utilization of systems that are susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to limit and prioritize the use of resources.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to control resource utilization of systems that are susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to limit and prioritize the use of resources.

### Planned and tracked
Capability & Performance Planning (CAP) are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Capacity management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for capability management.
- IT personnel work with:
o	Business stakeholders to identify business-critical systems and services.
o	Business stakeholders to identify single points of failure from a system/applications/services perspective.
- IT infrastructure personnel:
o	Create and maintain infrastructure performance metrics to understand current resource needs.
o	Deploy preventative technologies to minimize the effect of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against business-critical services.

### Well defined
Capability & Performance Planning (CAP) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), or similar function with technical competence to address cybersecurity concerns, analyzes the organization's business strategy to provide guidance for capacity and performance planning practices.
- The CISO, or similar function, develops a security-focused Concept of Operations (CONOPS) that documents management, operational and technical measures to apply defense-in-depth techniques across the organization. This CONOPS for capacity and performance planning may be incorporated as part of a broader operational plan for the cybersecurity & data privacy program.
- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) team, or similar function, provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization's applications, systems, services and data.
- A steering committee is formally established to provide executive oversight of the cybersecurity & data privacy program and establishes a clear and authoritative accountability structure for capacity and performance planning operations.
- IT personnel work with business stakeholders to identify business-critical systems and services, as part of the organization's IT Asset Management (ITAM) program.
- Automated tools continuously monitor the operating state and health status of systems/applications/services.
- Business stakeholders conduct a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) to determine acceptable downtime constraints and any dependencies between applications or systems, to objectively determine the criticality of systems, applications or services, as well as the order is which systems need to be restored.
- Demand is managed for computing resources based on BIA-defined prioritization.
- Based on BIA results, IT infrastructure personnel deploy preventative technologies to minimize the effect of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- IT architects identify appropriate solutions to make sure service levels can be met.
- IT infrastructure personnel:
o	Create an annual infrastructure growth plan with input from both technology and business stakeholders.
o	Create and maintain infrastructure performance metrics to understand current resource needs.
o	Produce a capacity plan that covers current use, forecasted needs and support costs for new systems, applications and services.
- Automated tools continuously monitor the operating state and health status of systems, applications and services to expand the availability of resources, as demand conditions change.
- IT personnel work with business stakeholders to identify single points of failure from a system/applications/services perspective.

### Quantitatively controlled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to control resource utilization of systems that are susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to limit and prioritize the use of resources.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to control resource utilization of systems that are susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to limit and prioritize the use of resources.
