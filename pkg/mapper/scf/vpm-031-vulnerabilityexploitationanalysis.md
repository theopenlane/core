# SCF - VPM-03.1 - Vulnerability Exploitation Analysis
Mechanisms exist to identify, assess, prioritize and document the potential impact(s) and likelihood(s) of applicable internal and external threats exploiting known vulnerabilities.

## Evidence request list


## Control questions
Does the organization identify, assess, prioritize and document the potential impact(s) and likelihood(s) of applicable internal and external threats exploiting known vulnerabilities?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to identify, assess, prioritize and document the potential impact(s) and likelihood(s) of applicable internal and external threats exploiting known vulnerabilities.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to identify, assess, prioritize and document the potential impact(s) and likelihood(s) of applicable internal and external threats exploiting known vulnerabilities.

### Planned and tracked
Vulnerability & Patch Management (VPM) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Attack Surface Management (ASM) is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel:
o	Identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for ASM.
o	Apply software patches and other vulnerability remediation efforts.
- Administrative processes and technologies focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed.

### Well defined
Vulnerability & Patch Management (VPM) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, categorizes devices according to the data the asset stores, transmits and/ or processes and applies the appropriate technology controls to protect the asset and data.
- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function:
o	Defines the scope of ASM activities.
o	Provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization's applications, systems, services and data with regards to ASM.
o	Provides oversight of ASM activities to centrally manage the flaw remediation process as part of the organization's overall Patch& Vulnerability & Patch Management Program (VPMP).
- A Security Operations Center (SOC), or similar function:
o	Manages the identification, tracking and remediation of vulnerabilities.
o	Utilizes a Security Incident Event monitor (SIEM), or similar automated tool, to monitor for unauthorized activities, accounts, connections, devices and software according to organization-specific Indicators of Compromise (IoC), including feeds from applications, hosts, network devices and vulnerability scanners.
- Asset custodians install the latest stable version of security-related updates on all systems within the organization-defined time requirements.

### Quantitatively controlled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to identify, assess, prioritize and document the potential impact(s) and likelihood(s) of applicable internal and external threats exploiting known vulnerabilities.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to identify, assess, prioritize and document the potential impact(s) and likelihood(s) of applicable internal and external threats exploiting known vulnerabilities. activities.
