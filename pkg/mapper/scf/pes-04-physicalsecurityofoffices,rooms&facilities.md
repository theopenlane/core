# SCF - PES-04 - Physical Security of Offices, Rooms & Facilities
Mechanisms exist to identify systems, equipment and respective operating environments that require limited physical access so that appropriate physical access controls are designed and implemented for offices, rooms and facilities.
## Mapped framework controls

## Evidence request list


## Control questions
Does the organization identify systems, equipment and respective operating environments that require limited physical access so that appropriate physical access controls are designed and implemented for offices, rooms and facilities?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to identify systems, equipment and respective operating environments that require limited physical access so that appropriate physical access controls are designed and implemented for offices, rooms and facilities.

### Performed internally
Physical & Environmental Security (PES) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Physical access control is decentralized.
- Physical security controls are primarily administrative in nature (e.g., policies & standards), focusing on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs).
- Human Resources, or a similar function, maintains a current list of personnel and facilitates the implementation of physical access management controls.
- Facility security mechanisms exist to monitor physical access to business-critical information systems or sensitive/regulated data, in addition to the physical access monitoring of the facility.

### Planned and tracked
Physical & Environmental Security (PES) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Physical access control is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for physical access control.
- Human Resources, or a similar function, maintains a current list of personnel with authorized access to organizational facilities and facilitates the implementation of physical access management controls.
- Physical security controls are primarily administrative in nature (e.g., policies & standards).
- Physical controls, administrative processes and technologies are primarily designed and implemented for offices, rooms and facilities that focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed.
- A facilities maintenance team, or similar function, manages the operation of automated physical and environmental protection controls.
- Physical controls are designed and implemented for offices, rooms and facilities.

### Well defined
Physical & Environmental Security (PES) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- A physical security team, or similar function:
o	Performs the centralized-management of physical security controls across the enterprise.
o	Maintains a current list of personnel with authorized access to organizational facilities and implements physical access management controls.
- A facilities maintenance team, or similar function, manages the operation of environmental protection controls.
- Administrative processes exist to authorize physical access to facilities based on the position or role of the individual.
- Administrative processes and physical controls restrict unescorted access to facilities to personnel with required security clearances, formal access authorizations and validated the need for access.
- Physical controls are designed and implemented for offices, rooms and facilities.

### Quantitatively controlled
Physical & Environmental Security (PES) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to identify systems, equipment and respective operating environments that require limited physical access so that appropriate physical access controls are designed and implemented for offices, rooms and facilities.
