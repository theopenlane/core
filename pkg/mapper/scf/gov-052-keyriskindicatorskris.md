# SCF - GOV-05.2 - Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
Mechanisms exist to develop, report and monitor Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) to assist senior management in performance monitoring and trend analysis of the cybersecurity & data privacy program.
## Mapped framework controls
### SOC 2
- [CC1.2](../soc2/cc12.md)
- [CC1.5](../soc2/cc15.md)
- [CC2.2](../soc2/cc22.md)
- [CC4.1](../soc2/cc41.md)

## Evidence request list


## Control questions
Does the organization develop, report and monitor Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) to assist senior management in performance monitoring and trend analysis of the cybersecurity & data privacy program?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to develop, report and monitor Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) to assist senior management in performance monitoring and trend analysis of the cybersecurity & data privacy program.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to develop, report and monitor Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) to assist senior management in performance monitoring and trend analysis of the cybersecurity & data privacy program.

### Planned and tracked
SP-CMM2 is N/A, since a well-defined process is required to develop, report and monitor Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) to assist senior management in performance monitoring and trend analysis of the cybersecurity & data privacy program.

### Well defined
Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Statutory, regulatory and contractual compliance requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy are identified and documented. Recurring testing is utilized to assess adherence to internal standards and/or external compliance requirements.
- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides scoping guidance to determine control applicability.
- Internal policies and standards address all statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations for cybersecurity & data privacy.
- Controls are standardized across the organization to ensure uniformity and consistent execution.
- Corporate governance (executive oversight) exists for the cybersecurity and data privacy, which includes regular briefings to ensure executives have sufficient situational awareness to properly govern the organization.
- Procedures are established for sensitive/regulated compliance obligations that are standardized across the organization.
- Defined roles & responsibilities require data/process owners to define, implement and maintain cybersecurity & data privacy controls for each system, application and/ or service of which they have accountability.
- The organization designates one or more qualified individuals to govern the cybersecurity and data privacy programs (e.g., Chief Information Security Officer or Chief Privacy Officer).
- Risk management processes are defined, to include materiality considerations.

### Quantitatively controlled
Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Metrics are developed that provide management insight, per a quantitative understanding of process capabilities, to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement.
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.

### Continuously improving
Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are “world-class” capabilities that leverage predictive analysis (e.g., machine learning, AI, etc.). In addition to CMM Level 4 criteria, CMM Level 5 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Stakeholders make time-sensitive decisions to support operational efficiency, which may include automated remediation actions.
- Based on predictive analysis, process improvements are implemented according to “continuous improvement” practices that affect process changes.
