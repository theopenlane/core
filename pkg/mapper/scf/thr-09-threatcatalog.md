# SCF - THR-09 - Threat Catalog
Mechanisms exist to develop and keep current a catalog of applicable internal and external threats to the organization, both natural and manmade.
## Mapped framework controls

## Evidence request list
E-THR-06

## Control questions
Does the organization develop and keep current a catalog of applicable internal and external threats to the organization, both natural and manmade?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to develop and keep current a catalog of applicable internal and external threats to the organization, both natural and manmade.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to develop and keep current a catalog of applicable internal and external threats to the organization, both natural and manmade.

### Planned and tracked
Threat Management (THR) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Threat management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- The HR department, in conjunction with cybersecurity personnel, helps ensure secure practices are implemented in personnel management operations to help manage threats.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel:
o	Identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for threat management.
o	Subscribe to threat feeds to maintain situational awareness of emerging threats.

### Well defined
Threat Management (THR) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- A Security Operations Center (SOC), or similar function:
o	Subscribes to threat feeds to maintain situational awareness of emerging threats.
o	Develops Indicators of Exposure (IOE) to better understand potential attack vectors that attackers could use to attack the organization.
o	Implements a Threat Awareness Program (TAP) that includes a cross-organization information-sharing capability.
o	Implements a “threat hunting” capability to actively identify internal threats.
- An Integrated Security Incident Response Team (ISIRT), or similar function, exists to form an on-demand, integrated team of cybersecurity, IT, data privacy and business function representatives that can execute coordinated incident response operations, including a cross-discipline incident handling capability.
- Cybersecurity personnel enable security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.

### Quantitatively controlled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to develop and keep current a catalog of applicable internal and external threats to the organization, both natural and manmade.

### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to develop and keep current a catalog of applicable internal and external threats to the organization, both natural and manmade.
