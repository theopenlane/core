## Evidence request list


## Control questions
Does the organization facilitate the implementation of configuration management controls?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to facilitate the implementation of configuration management controls.

### Performed internally
Configuration Management (CFG) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- IT personnel use an informal process to design, build and maintain secure configurations for test, development, staging and production environments.
- Secure configurations are not:
o	Standardized across the organization.
o	Consistently aligned with industry-recognized standards for hardening (e.g., DISA STIGs, CIS Benchmarks or OEM security guides).

### Planned and tracked
Configuration Management (CFG) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Configuration management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for configuration management.
- Technologies are configured to protect data with the strength and integrity commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of the information and mostly conform to industry-recognized standards for hardening (e.g., DISA STIGs, CIS Benchmarks or OEM security guides), including cryptographic protections for sensitive/regulated data.
- Special baseline configurations are created for higher-risk environments or for systems, applications and services that store, process or transmit sensitive/regulated data.
- Apart from workstation and server operating system baselines, configuration management is decentralized.
- Cybersecurity personnel use a structured process to design, build and maintain secure configurations for test, development, staging and production environments.
- Deviations to baseline configurations are required to have a risk assessment and the business process owner acceptance of the risk(s) associated with the deviation.
- Unauthorized configuration changes are investigated to determine if the unauthorized configuration is malicious in nature.
- Logical Access Control (LAC) is enforced to prohibit non-administrative users from being able to install unauthorized software.

### Well defined
Configuration Management (CFG) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), or similar function with technical competence to address cybersecurity concerns, analyzes the organization's business strategy to determine prioritized and authoritative guidance for secure configuration management practices.
- The CISO, or similar function, develops a security-focused Concept of Operations (CONOPS) that documents management, operational and technical measures to apply defense-in-depth techniques across the organization with regards to secure configuration management.
- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization's applications, systems, services and data to ensure that secure configuration management are identified and documented.
- A steering committee is formally established to provide executive oversight of the cybersecurity & data privacy program, including secure configuration management to provide clear and authoritative accountability for secure configuration management operations.
- The configuration management function is formally assigned with defined roles and responsibilities.
- An IT infrastructure team, or similar function, ensures that statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy obligations are addressed to ensure secure configurations are designed, built and maintained.
- Configuration management is centralized for all operating systems, applications, servers and other configurable technologies.
- Technologies are configured to protect data with the strength and integrity commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of the information and conform to industry-recognized standards for hardening (e.g., DISA STIGs, CIS Benchmarks or OEM security guides), including test, development, staging and production environments.
- Configurations conform to industry-recognized standards for hardening (e.g., DISA STIGs, CIS Benchmarks or OEM security guides) for test, development, staging and production environments.
- Deviations to baseline configurations are required to have a risk assessment and business process owner approval of the risk(s) associated with the deviation.
- Special baseline configurations are created for higher-risk environments or for systems, applications and services that store, process or transmit sensitive/regulated data.
- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, ensures compliance with requirements for asset management.
- Logical Access Control (LAC) is used to limit the ability of non-administrators from making configuration changes to systems, applications and services, including the of installation of unauthorized software.
- A Security Incident Event Manager (SIEM), or similar automated tool, monitors for unauthorized activities, accounts, connections, devices and software.
Unauthorized configuration changes are responded to in accordance with an Incident Response Plan (IRP) to determine if the unauthorized configuration is malicious in nature.

### Quantitatively controlled
Configuration Management (CFG) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.

### Continuously improving
Configuration Management (CFG) efforts are “world-class” capabilities that leverage predictive analysis (e.g., machine learning, AI, etc.). In addition to CMM Level 4 criteria, CMM Level 5 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Stakeholders make time-sensitive decisions to support operational efficiency, which may include automated remediation actions.
- Based on predictive analysis, process improvements are implemented according to “continuous improvement” practices that affect process changes.
