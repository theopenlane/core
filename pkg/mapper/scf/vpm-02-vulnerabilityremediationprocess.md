# SCF - VPM-02 - Vulnerability Remediation Process
Mechanisms exist to ensure that vulnerabilities are properly identified, tracked and remediated.
## Mapped framework controls
### ISO 27002
- [A.8.8](../iso27002/a-8.md#a88)

### SOC 2
- [CC4.2](../soc2/cc42.md)
- [CC5.3-POF4](../soc2/cc53-pof4.md)
- [CC7.4-POF8](../soc2/cc74-pof8.md)

## Evidence request list


## Control questions
Does the organization ensure that vulnerabilities are properly identified, tracked and remediated?

## Compliance methods


## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to ensure that vulnerabilities are properly identified, tracked and remediated.

### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to ensure that vulnerabilities are properly identified, tracked and remediated.

### Planned and tracked
Vulnerability & Patch Management (VPM) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Attack Surface Management (ASM) is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
- IT/cybersecurity personnel:
o	Identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for ASM.
o	Apply software patches and other vulnerability remediation efforts.
- Administrative processes and technologies focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed.

### Well defined
Vulnerability & Patch Management (VPM) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, categorizes devices according to the data the asset stores, transmits and/ or processes and applies the appropriate technology controls to protect the asset and data.
- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function:
o	Defines the scope of ASM activities.
o	Provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization's applications, systems, services and data with regards to ASM.
o	Provides oversight of ASM activities to centrally manage the flaw remediation process as part of the organization's overall Patch& Vulnerability & Patch Management Program (VPMP).
- A Security Operations Center (SOC), or similar function:
o	Manages the identification, tracking and remediation of vulnerabilities.
o	Utilizes a Security Incident Event monitor (SIEM), or similar automated tool, to monitor for unauthorized activities, accounts, connections, devices and software according to organization-specific Indicators of Compromise (IoC), including feeds from applications, hosts, network devices and vulnerability scanners.
- Asset custodians install the latest stable version of security-related updates on all systems within the organization-defined time requirements.

### Quantitatively controlled
Vulnerability & Patch Management (VPM) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.

### Continuously improving
Vulnerability & Patch Management (VPM) efforts are “world-class” capabilities that leverage predictive analysis (e.g., machine learning, AI, etc.). In addition to CMM Level 4 criteria, CMM Level 5 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- Stakeholders make time-sensitive decisions to support operational efficiency, which may include automated remediation actions.
- Based on predictive analysis, process improvements are implemented according to “continuous improvement” practices that affect process changes.
