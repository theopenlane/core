# Contributing

Please read the [contributing](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide as well as the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). You will be required to sign all commits to the Openlane project, so if you're unfamiliar with how to set that up, see [github's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).

Given external users will not have write to the branches in this repository, you'll need to follow the forking process to open a PR - [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) is a guide from github on how to do so.
